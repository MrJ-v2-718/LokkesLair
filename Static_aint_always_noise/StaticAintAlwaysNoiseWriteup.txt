I am provided with two files, 'static' and ltdis.sh
I run static with ./static and get:
Oh hai! Wait what? A flag? Yes, it's around here somewhere!

When I try to run ./ltdis.sh I get:
Attempting disassembly of  ...
objdump: 'a.out': No such file
objdump: section '.text' mentioned in a -j option, but not found in any input file
Disassembly failed!
Usage: ltdis.sh <program-file>
Bye!

I see that the usage requires a program file to be parsed as an option so I try:
./ltdis.sh static

This generates static.ltdis.strings.txt

I ctrl + F 'pico' through it to find the flag:
picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_ae0b3ef2}
