Used wget to download index.html from the url provided.
After using cat to inspect the code in the terminal I noticed
picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
With the annotation that this was 1/3 of the flag.

After inspecting the mycss.css I found:
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

After inspecting myjs.js I found:
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699} */

Flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}

A true detective indeed.
