I connect to the server with the command:

ssh ctf-player@venus.pcioctf.net -p 50713 and use the password provided, 6d448c9c.

Using ls lists the first of three flags in a text file 1of3.flag.txt:

picoCTF{xxsh_

next I:

cat instructions-to-2of3.txt 

which instructs me to go to the root of all things.

I use:

cd ..

To go back a directory and:

cat 3of3.flag.txt

which gives me the tail end of the flag. I keep reverse tunneling until I find 2of3:

0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

By my superpowers of deduction I somehow manage to assemble them:

picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_540e4e79}
