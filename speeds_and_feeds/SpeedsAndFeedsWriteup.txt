There is something on my shop network running at 
nc mercury.picoctf.net 33596
but I can't tell what it is. Can you?

Hint: What language does a CNC machine use?
My search engine says G-code and the feed matches it's description
G-code files have a .gcode extension

Connected to port using netcat and sent results to txt file:

nc mercury.picoctf.net 33596 > SeedsAndFeeds.gcode

https://ncviewer.com/ is an online .gcode viewer and I opened up the file
to find the flag in plain sight. Snagged a screenshot
Flag: picoCTF{num3r1cal_c0ntr0l_e7749028}
