Hints
What do you think about my pet? dachshund.jpg

First things first, I need that picture of a dachshund so I use wget to download:
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/169e308c502d8b0fde11bb2e98e463cb/dachshund.jpg
It is as cute as I thought it would be. Even if I can't solve this, it was worth it now.
Those stubby little legs, the regal demeanor, the short and manageable coat. A good dog indeed.

Let's look at it in a hex editor, my go to is ghex but you can use any you like:
sudo apt install ghex

This caught my eye:

Now, let's connect with netcat:

I am greeted with:

Welcome to my RSA challenge!

Looks like another RSA challenge and we're given e, n, and c.

After some research on previous writeups it seems that there is a type of RSA attack called "Wiener's Attack"
and it occurs when "d" is too small as it says in the challenge.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_attack

There is a readily available Weiner Attack Implementation in Python3 called oWiener

I install with the command:
pip install owiener

I use the example provided on pypi to make my own solution script.
It didn't run because pip didn't complete the installation properly, let's try curl

Install curl with:
sudo apt install curl

Then owiener with:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orisano/owiener/master/owiener.py

Ran the program to receive the hacked d as well as the decrypted message in decimal format.
Hacked d=8099868649823267453558366988941117570498435659123432543094497886711760130075

Let's convert to hex:

For the flag:
picoCTF{proving_wiener_3878674}

Thanks to Nao Yonashiro for owiener :)
