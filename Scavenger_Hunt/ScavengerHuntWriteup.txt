Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site 
http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/. Can you find it?

Hints
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

After visiting the site I used ctrl + shift + I to look at the code
Found: Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t-->

Navigated to Sytle Editor tab and found mycss.css with part 2 of the flag:
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. 
Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */

Navigated to myjs.js from the Inspector and found:
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
I hadn't the slightest, so I searched it up and found some stuff
about how google searches:

"Most of our Search index is built through the work of software known as crawlers. 
These automatically visit publicly accessible webpages and follow links on those pages, 
much like you would if you were browsing content on the web. They go from page to page 
and store information about what they find on these pages and other publicly-accessible 
content in Google's Search index."

"Google also provides a free toolset called Search Console that creators can use to help 
us better crawl their content. They can also make use of established standards like 
sitemaps or robots.txt to indicate how often content should be visited or if it shouldn't 
be included in our Search index at all."

Changed myjs.js to robots.txt in the Inspector using 'Edit as HTML' 
and followed the link to find:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?

The .htacess file manages Apache server permissions. 
Replacing robots.txt with .htaccess gives:
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

Note: Store is capitalized abnormally.
In Macs, a .DS_Store file stores the configurations for how the desktop appears 
(i.e. icons, etc....) Changing .htacess to .DS_Store gives:
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _74cceb07}
