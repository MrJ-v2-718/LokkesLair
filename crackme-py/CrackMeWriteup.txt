I use wget to snag crackme.py

After analyzing the program, I notice:

# Hiding this really important number in an obscure piece of code is brilliant!
# AND it's encrypted!
# We want our biggest client to know his information is safe with us.
bezos_cc_secret = "A:4@r%uL`M-^M0c0AbcM-MFE02fh3e4a5N"

There is a built in decode_secret method, but it is never called. I added a call:

decode_secret(bezos_cc_secret)

I run it and bam:

picoCTF{1|\/|_4_p34|\|ut_a79b6c2d}
