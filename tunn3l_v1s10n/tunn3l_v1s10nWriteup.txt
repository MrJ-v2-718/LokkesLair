I use wget to snag dat file and lo and behold, there's no file extension.
Opened it up in my favorite hex editor, ghex, and the first two characters are BM,
which indicates a BMP file, not a bowel movement. Weird...

Changed extension to bmp and it still doesn't open, so I install ImageMagick:

sudo apt install imagemagick

After opening I notice it looks super cramped and weirdly sized.
The picture is adorned with the characters "notaflag{sorry}"
This site explains bmp stuffs:
https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm

After some "light" reading, I found that height on a BMP file starts at offset 0016h, so I changed 
0017h from 0x01 to 0x03. Fun fact: altering RAFT saves and solving this puzzle have a lot in common.
Who would have thought?
