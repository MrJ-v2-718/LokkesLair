Navigated to site and used ctrl + shift + I to switch to
inspection view. Since were looking for cookies, I navigated to
storage and found one cookie with a value of zero. Changing
this value leads to changes in the page once refreshed. 1 is
"I love chocolate chip cookies!" and continues professing it's love
for different cookies until 18 which drops the flag in the format:
